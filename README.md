# Increasing Information for Model Predictive Control with Semi-Markov Decision Processes



This work extends the ideas from the two papers of Mehta et al. :

- [V. Mehta et al. - An Experimental Design Perspective on Model-Based Reinforcement
  Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05244) (*ICLR 2022*)
- [V. Mehta et al. - Exploration via Planning for Information about the Optimal Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04642)
  (*NeurIPS 2022*)

The proposed implementation is based on V. Mehta et al. [repository](https://github.com/fusion-ml/trajectory-information-rl/tree/main).
Notably, it adds type-hinting support, and it is available as a python package.
